		<h2>Master Ball</h2>
		<p>The Master Ball (Japanese: マスターボール Master Ball) is a type of Poké Ball introduced in Generation I. It can be used to catch a wild Pokémon without fail.<br> The Master Ball, like all Poké Balls, is spherical in shape. The top and bottom halves are divided by a horizontal black band, on which the button is found on all Poké Balls. The top half of the Master Ball is purple, with a white letter "M" on the front, with a pink circle on either side. Master Balls are developed by Silph Co. A guaranteed catch. As rare as Psyduck’s teeth.</p>
